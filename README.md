AI-Assisted Development of a Premium HTML eCommerce Interface
📍 Overview

This capstone explores how Generative AI accelerated my learning and refinement of advanced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript techniques by building a premium, interactive eCommerce interface.

The project demonstrates:

    Advanced CSS styling (Glassmorphism, Custom Cursor, Premium UI)

    JavaScript cart simulation logic

    DOM manipulation

    UI animations and transitions

    Responsive design

AI was used to:

    Refine layout structure

    Improve cart logic

    Optimize animations

    Debug JavaScript issues

    Enhance UI polish

🎯 Project Goal

To build a fully functional, premium-themed cosmetic eCommerce webpage using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, while documenting how AI supported the learning and development process.

This project is a simulation (no real payments or backend).

📱 Responsive Design

    Grid collapses to single column

    Cursor disabled on touch devices

What I Learned

Through AI-assisted prompting, I learned:

    Advanced CSS transitions

    Grid layout optimization

    Sticky positioning techniques

    JavaScript array-based cart systems

    DOM manipulation best practices

    Toast notification implementation

    Custom cursor creation

Minimal Working Example

The entire system runs inside:

addToCart(name, price)
updateCart()
checkout()

Example Cart Logic

let cart = [];
let totalAmount = 0;

function addToCart(name, price) {
    cart.push({name, price});
    totalAmount += price;
    updateCart();
}

Expected Behavior

    Click “Acquire”

    Item added to bag

    Toast notification appears

    Total updates automatically

    Checkout simulates confirmation

    Cart resets

Common Issues & Fixes
Issue	Cause	Fix
Toast not appearing	Class not toggled	Ensure .active is added & removed
Total not updating	updateCart() not called	Call function after push
Cursor lagging	Too much delay	Reduce setTimeout delay
Scrollbar styling not visible	Browser compatibility	Use Webkit prefix
Reflection on AI’s Role

AI significantly accelerated:

    UI ideation

    Layout structuring

    Animation design

    Debugging logic errors

    Performance refinements

However:

    Manual testing was necessary

    Some animation timing required human adjustment

    Code cleanup required restructuring beyond AI output

AI served as:

    A technical assistant, not a replacement for understanding.
